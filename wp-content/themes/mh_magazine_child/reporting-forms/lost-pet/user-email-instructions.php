 	<li>One of the most important steps – Immediately <strong>VISIT</strong> <em>(DO NOT CALL)</em> your local Animal Control/Humane Societies in an approximately 10-20 mile range to look for him/her and to file a LOST report so they can be on the lookout for him/her.  <strong>Keep visiting regularly to check as well. It is especially helpful to take a flyer that has his/her pictures on it. Indianapolis Animal Care Services at 2600 S. Harding St., and <span class="_5yl5">Indianapolis Humane Society at 7929 N Michigan Rd both have only 4 day stray holds.  Some people may also take a found pet to Southside Animal Shelter.  Please check these shelters as soon as possible. </span>Link to listing of all shelters</strong> – <a href="http://www.indylostpetalert.com/shelters/">http://www.indylostpetalert.com/shelters/</a></li>

 	<li>Have flyers copied (can use the posting we have created for your pet) to distribute. Not all folks use social media!</li>
 	<li>If your dog or cat is microchipped, please make sure to update any outdated info throughout the chip company ASAP!  You can always contact the place that put the chip in for the number/chip company info. Visit <a href="http://www.indylostpetalert.com/microchipping/">http://www.indylostpetalert.com/microchipping/</a> for more information.</li>
 	<li>Search your neighborhood, knock on doors and talk to all your neighbors. Leave a paper flyer with them in case they find your pet at a later time. Walk or drive slowly through your neighborhood and make some noise while you go around the neighborhood (call the pet’s name also). Animals can hear you from very long distances. Bring your pets favorite things with you, a “squeaky” toy or favorite treats and rattle them loudly while calling your pet’s name. It’s also important to stop regularly, be quiet, and listen to see if your pet is making any noise. Sometimes they may make a noise in reply or they may be hiding somewhere whimpering or barking.</li>
 	<li>Please share his/her alert on your FB page and ask others to share. If you have a neighborhood or town FB page or email list, please get the word out about him/her using these methods also.  Many neighborhoods have the <a href="http://nextdoor.com/">nextdoor.com</a> website that you can post your pet to as well.</li>
 	<li>Review the FOUND PETS albums on our website just in case your pet has already been found !  Go to indylostpetalert.com, then click on FOUND ALBUMS.</li>
 	<li>Post lots of signs in the area and within a 2 mile radius of where he/she went missing, especially entrances/exits of your neighborhood. Grocery stores and pet stores are also great places to put signs. If you need examples of signs, just ask and we can provide some.  Clear contact paper or clear packaging tape can help to make them waterproof.  Neon poster board from a dollar store makes great signs!</li>
 	<li>Please share your pet’s flyer with your mail/UPS/FedEx person.  They usually spend a lot of time in your neighborhood and often know where pets live and contact any local veterinarians to let them know your pet is missing.  Giving them a color flyer is even better so they know exactly what your pet looks like.</li>
 	<li>BEWARE of SCAMMERS!  As much as we despise it, we know there are dishonest folks who peruse our pages for illegal means. Beware of contacts made by others who claim to have your pet and demand money for its return.  Also, beware of those who claim to offer a paid service to find your pet.  Please forward all such info to us and we will involve the local PD!</li>

<ul>
 	<li>Indoor kitties generally do not venture far when they get out- ¼ – 1/2 mi at most, usually no more than 6-8 houses away. Look under bushes, decks, piles of wood or junk, sheds, in basement window wells, etc.</li>
 	<li>Place a cat carrier or box close to the house in a ‘sheltered’ area. Fill with his/her food, and clothing or a blanket with his/her scent and your scent. Note: if there are coyotes in your neighborhood, please do NOT put food out.</li>
 	<li>Put the dirty litter box outside at the back door or on the porch, in a sheltered area near the house. This may help your cat find his/her way home.</li>
 	<li>Visit with all neighbors and ask them to check their property, including inside garages, sheds, and basements etc. Provide them with a contact number to reach you quickly if they see him/her.</li>
